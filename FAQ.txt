FAQ.
IMPORTANT:
Currently, If you have another resolution than 1920x1080
you have to start the script, after getting into the loading screen,
this is because the script will try to find the league of legends window,
in order to find out how big it is, so that it nows where to place the mouse.

Can I use a playstation controller?
NO, currently you can only use an xbox controller.

Why does the program take the mouse hostage?
Taking controll over the mouse is the purpose of this program
it's most likley that the resting position of the joystick is above the moving threshold.
Try adjusting the joystick to, free it.
if you however make a script that always forces the mouse position you can either press the abort key which default to F5 in the globalSettings.lua
or just alt-f4 the program.

The mouse positioning is weird.
I wrote the bindings with 1920x1080 resolution in mind, i tried to make it resolution independant,
but some things might be wrongly placed if you have a different resolution,
you unfortunately have to modify the script to fix that.

My computer is acting weird after stopping the program!
When you stop the program and a button is held down,
currently the program wonâ€™t release the button.
Meaning the ctrl button could always be held down. Fix it by pressing the buttons that are down.
